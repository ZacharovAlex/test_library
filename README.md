Package for training dart basics

## Features

1. Methods for calculating NOD and NOC of integers.  Splits a number into prime factors and returns them.

2. Methods to convert integers from decimal to binary and back.

3. A method that takes a string of words separated by spaces. Finds numbers in this string and returns a collection num of these numbers.

4. A method that takes a collection of words. Returns Map. This Map correlates a word and the number of occurrences of that word in the given collection.

5. There is a collection of strings of the form 'one, two, three, cat, dog' or any other. The method returns the numbers without repetitions (Set) that occur in the given string. However, the numbers occur as English words from zero to nine.

6. The method takes three points in three-dimensional space and returns the area of the triangle that these points form.

7. The root of any given degree from a number. Method as an extension-method for num.

8. A getMailSystem method that returns a value from an email that is after @. For example, if the user's email is user@mail.ru, this method will return mail.ru.

9. A method that calculates the value of a certain Riemann integral in given values and with a given partitioning accuracy. It outputs the discontinuity points.
